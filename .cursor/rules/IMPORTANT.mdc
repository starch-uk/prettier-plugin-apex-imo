# Documentation Update Requirement

**CRITICAL**: When making any changes to the project (including but not limited to):
- Package manager versions (pnpm, npm, etc.)
- Node.js version requirements
- CI/CD workflow configurations
- Dependencies or devDependencies
- Project structure or setup
- Build or test configurations

You MUST update both:
1. **README.md** - Update relevant sections (requirements, installation, usage, etc.)
2. **PLAN.md** - Update all relevant sections including examples, configurations, and workflow definitions

This ensures documentation stays in sync with the actual codebase and prevents confusion for contributors and users.

Refer to documentation files in `docs/*.md`:
- `docs/ESLINT.md` - ESLint reference and configuration
- `docs/HUSKY9.md` - Husky v9 reference and setup
- `docs/PNPM.md` - pnpm reference and usage
