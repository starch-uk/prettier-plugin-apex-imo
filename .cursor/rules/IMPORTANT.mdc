# Documentation Update Requirement

**CRITICAL**: When making any changes to the project (including but not limited to):
- Package manager versions (pnpm, npm, etc.)
- Node.js version requirements
- CI/CD workflow configurations
- Dependencies or devDependencies
- Project structure or setup
- Build or test configurations

You MUST update both:
1. **README.md** - Update relevant sections (requirements, installation, usage, etc.)
2. **PLAN.md** - Update all relevant sections including examples, configurations, and workflow definitions

This ensures documentation stays in sync with the actual codebase and prevents confusion for contributors and users.

Refer to documentation files in `docs/*.md`:
- `docs/APEXDOC.md` - ApexDoc quick reference for AI agents
- `docs/ESLINT.md` - ESLint reference and configuration
- `docs/HUSKY9.md` - Husky v9 reference and setup
- `docs/PNPM.md` - pnpm reference and usage
- `docs/VITEST.md` - Vitest reference and configuration

## External Code Inspection

For reference implementation inspection, the following repositories can be checked out to environmental temporary folders:
- **prettier**: https://github.com/prettier/prettier.git
- **prettier-plugin-apex**: https://github.com/dangmai/prettier-plugin-apex.git

These can be cloned to temporary directories for code inspection and reference when implementing features or debugging issues.
